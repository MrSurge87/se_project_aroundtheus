# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This is a webpage deisgn for a person who has traveled across the world to different locations.

**Figma**

- I used the Figma platform to review the webpage content to create the display layout needed.

**Images**

I used the images provided to me in a separate folder and imported them to the webpage.
Images consisted of different outdoor parks and some national parks.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
